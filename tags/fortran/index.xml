      <description>To compile some Fortran code that used features newer than Fortran 95, I switched the default gfortran from the conda one (version 4.8) to the latest GCC one (version 7.3). After that, I found that I could no longer execute some previously compiled Fortran programs and I also ran into troubles with some Anaconda Python packages. (Maybe it was my fault not to statically link them.) I got the same error for all of them:</description>

I thought I knew how to write subroutines in Fortran 90, but when I decided to write pure functions in the latest Fortran style, which was Fortran 2008, it did not go as well as I expected. The compiler yelled at me a screenful of errors.</description>
